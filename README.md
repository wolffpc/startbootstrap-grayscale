# Peter Wolff - Portfolio Site

##About

This is a portfolio website that I setup for myself to be included or linked on my social media profiles and resume. I strove to keep the changes I made to the original template documented and added comments where I thought appropriate to the original code.

If you have any issues please feel free to contact me or create an issue here. Thanks!

##Credits

Peter Wolff modified the original Grayscale template.
