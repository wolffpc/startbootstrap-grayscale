# Peter Wolff - Portfolio Site

##About

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is a portfolio website that I setup for myself to be included or linked on my social media profiles and resume. I strove to keep the changes I made to the original template documented and even added comments where I thought appropriate to the original code.
